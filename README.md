# cancer-diagnosis-knn
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the type of cancer based on gene expression data. The dataset includes 20 genes as biomarkers used to classify cancer types. The goal is to use KNN to predict the cancer type for a given test dataset based on training data.
